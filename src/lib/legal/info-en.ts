**Version ${appVersion}** · Stable channel · Build ${appVersion} (NSIS x64) · ${releaseDate}
Academic productivity system for Windows and Android
Developed by **VT Asvent**, a software development entity in formation · Peru

Available in Spanish and English (Settings → “Language”).

Frame brings together in a single application what usually takes five: managing subjects and tasks, timing your study with a daily grade, habit tracking, a calendar, a player for your own music, voice recording and Google’s services. Its academic core works offline, all your information is saved first on your own computer and, with an account, it syncs in seconds with Frame for Android.

---

## 1 · System requirements

**Operating system.** Windows 10 version 1809 (build 17763) or later, or Windows 11, on x64 computers. For tablets and phones there’s **Frame for Android** (Android 8.0 or later), downloaded from the same page and sharing account and data. There’s no version for macOS, Linux or iOS.

**Required component.** Frame uses the **Microsoft Edge WebView2** runtime, distributed by Microsoft and included by default in Windows 11 and in up-to-date Windows 10 installations. If it isn’t present, the installer detects it and asks to install it. Without this component the application doesn’t start.

**Resources.** 4 GB of memory and 300 MB of free space, plus the space taken by your music library and your recordings, which grows with no limit set by the application.

**Internet connection.** It isn’t needed for the academic core —subjects, tasks, study sessions, habits, the local calendar, your music and your recordings—. It is needed to create your account and sign in —once inside, all of the above keeps working without it—, for cloud sync, the YouTube, Gmail and Classroom screens, study videos, the weather card and checking for updates.

**System permissions.** Frame asks for access to the microphone for voice recording, to the file system for attachments, covers, reports and the music library, and for permission to show native notifications and an always-on-top window above other applications (the clock’s floating view). These permissions are used only for the functions described.

## 2 · Your account identifier

**${installId}**

It’s a twelve-digit **pseudonymous** identifier, the same one the Terms call the “installation identifier”. It’s derived from the internal, random code that the account service assigned to your account when it was created; for local profiles from before version 1.4.9 it was generated at random when the profile was created. It isn’t derived from your name, your email, your hardware or any data from your computer, and on its own it doesn’t identify you.

It has a single purpose: making sure a support report or a request about your data is linked to the right account without you having to give your email. You can also see it in Settings, next to your profile, and it’s copied with one click. Always include it when you write to support. Don’t post it on forums or social media: although it doesn’t identify you, it does uniquely identify your account.

Since it belongs to your account, it’s the same on every computer where you sign in and it doesn’t change even if you uninstall and reinstall Frame.

---

## 3 · Where each piece of data lives

Frame distinguishes three storage places. Knowing the difference is what prevents an irreversible loss.

**On your computer, always.** Everything you record is written first to your disk: subjects, collections, tasks, attachments, study sessions, grades, habits, local calendar events, resources, images, voice recordings and your music library. Recordings are also kept as audio files (M4A) in \`Documents\\Frame\\Grabaciones\`, accessible outside the application.

**In your account, if you signed in.** Your **academic state** —subjects, tasks, sessions, grades, habits, events, playlists with their order, study videos and settings— is replicated in the cloud and merged across devices: each change reaches your other devices in under a second, encrypted. This replica is what lets you switch machines, or use your phone, without losing anything. The **language**, the **image proportion** of the cards and the weather city you pick by hand also follow your account; the theme belongs to each device. Your **profile picture** and the **schedule image** travel in a private folder of your account; the images from **Frame’s gallery** that you give your playlists, subjects and collections travel as a reference (which one it is and how you cropped it) and each device recreates it.

**Nowhere but your computer, always.** **Music** (with its covers and lyrics), **voice recordings**, **attachments** and **the images you upload yourself** to playlists, subjects and collections are excluded from the cloud because of their size. To have your music on another device, copy your files there and import them. The bell tells you what isn’t the same on your devices, where and why (sync checker).

**A guest profile has nothing in the cloud.** “Continue as a guest” creates a local profile to try Frame instantly: all of its information lives only on this computer. To keep it safe, link your account with Google or with your email (the “G” next to your profile, at the bottom of the menu, or Settings → gear → “Link my account”): everything moves to your account, is added to what it already had without deleting anything and gets backed up.

## 4 · What this version includes

### 4.1 Academic core

Subjects with a cover image, groupable into collections, with a teacher and their own statistics; resources (notes, links, files and recordings) arranged in their own tab, and a permanent record of what was completed.

The **“+”** button in the top bar creates a task or a note without going to the subject; a note with no subject stays as a card at the bottom of Home. Tasks with a description, subject, due date, priority, type, difficulty, estimated time and a progress percentage that you can adjust by hand or that rises on its own with your study sessions in proportion to the estimated time. Reminders task by task, with days, time and repetition. Attachments linked to the original file on your disk —chosen with one click or dragged, one or several, onto the “Attach file” box—: if you keep editing it, Frame always sees the current version.

An archive of completed and incomplete tasks, with time spent and punctuality; a daily notice of overdue tasks to reschedule, complete or drop them. Next to “Filters”, how many tasks you see and how much their estimated time adds up to.

**Import from Notion** (Settings → account gear) brings your tasks and dates from the export of a Notion database (the .zip or the .csv), without connecting to your account.

### 4.2 Study and measuring your study

Timer or stopwatch, with an always-visible **floating view** in two sizes. In **performance mode** you rate your concentration from 1 to 20 and Frame calculates the day’s grade (AD, A, B, C); in **time mode** only the minutes against your goal count.

When you finish, the form records the exact time, your focus, the subjects and tasks you worked on and **what you did, with a text editor with bold, italics and lists**; subjects and their tasks are chosen with cards. During the session you can log progress with its minute. If Frame closes with a session running, when you come back the same day you can resume it.

Each session is a card with its subject, its time and its performance, and it opens with all its detail. A grades calendar with the detail of each day (time against the goal, sessions, average focus, grade and when you studied: morning, afternoon or evening), weekly or monthly academic progress and YouTube study videos, watched with its player.

### 4.3 Analysis and reports

The top bar shows phrases with your recent data that change on their own. Home sums up your day: weather, schedule, yesterday’s grade, streak, weekly average, next task, “Your week in data” and the competency matrix (pending workload per subject, not a measure of knowledge). Habits with times of day, rings, a typical week and a consistency map. Performance and pending-tasks **reports** in PDF and Word —weekly, monthly or yearly—, in Settings, with a summary and the real preview of the document.

### 4.4 Calendar, Google and music

An offline local calendar, with cells that adapt to the window’s height: one-day or multi-day events, with a time and the same reminder as tasks (days, time and repetition), cell colors and selecting several days at once by dragging; **YouTube, Gmail and Classroom** built into the sidebar. A library with **your own music**: “Import” brings loose songs or whole folders from your computer —MP3, M4A, AAC, OGG, Opus, FLAC, WAV and WebM— with their cover (the one the file carries, an image with the same name or the folder’s) and their lyrics (the ones in their tags, or an .lrc or .txt with the same name); it separates the title from the artist even if the file has no tags and warns you about what it can’t play. It plays with synced lyrics —which you can also add later, from a file of yours, in “Now playing”—, playlists with their total length and favorites; clicking the playlist name in the player finds the song that’s playing. Voice recording from any screen (\`Ctrl+Shift+F\`), with the limit you choose, up to 4 hours. Updates show their size, the estimated time and the real progress before and during installation.

---

## 5 · Known limits and expected behavior

They’re documented here so none of them surprises you. They aren’t bugs.

Frame tells you about each new version (the “Update now” button and the bell) and **doesn’t install without your confirmation**.

Closing the window closes Frame. If a study session is running, it first offers to pause it, log it or keep studying. Reminders sound while Frame is open.

Document attachments stop resolving if the original file is moved, renamed or deleted: attach it again.

The competency radar and the daily grades are calculated exclusively from the data you record. They don’t come from any institution and have no academic validity.

Music, recordings, attachments and the images you upload yourself aren’t backed up in the cloud: they stay on the device where you added them.

Frame doesn’t search for or download music, videos, covers or lyrics: it shows the lyrics and cover that your files carry or the ones you add; what earlier versions already saved on your computer is kept. Formats that the Windows audio engine doesn’t play (WMA, AIFF, ALAC, APE and others) aren’t imported, and Frame tells you which ones were left out.

Google’s screens require a connection and being signed in to Google, and how they work depends entirely on Google.

---

## 6 · Third-party components and services

Frame is built on third-party software distributed under open licenses, listed in full in the **Third-party notices** section of the Terms and Conditions.

Google’s services —Gmail, YouTube and Classroom— are operated by Google LLC; their availability, content and terms depend on Google. Cloud backup and authentication run on **Supabase** infrastructure.

The weather forecast comes from **Open-Meteo**.

Notion is a trademark of Notion Labs, Inc.; the extension only reads the files you export yourself and doesn’t connect to its service.

Frame **plays audio files present on your computer**. The application doesn’t provide a music catalog or any license over protected works: you’re responsible for holding the necessary rights over the files you add to your library.

---

## 7 · Version channel and update cycle

Frame is distributed on a single, **stable** channel. Numbering follows the \`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH\` scheme. When an update changes the data format, Frame migrates it automatically on the first launch.

Support is offered for the current stable version and the one immediately before it. Older versions may stop syncing with the backup service without individual notice.

*1.5.6:* **linking your account, closer at hand**: anyone using a guest profile has a small “G” next to their profile, at the bottom of the menu; it opens the same sign-in box, with Google or with email and password, and everything of theirs moves to the account without losing anything · **“Offline”**: a brief notice at the bottom left that goes up to the bell and stays there as a notification; if the session was closed, you sign in again from it.

*1.5.5:* **images travel between your devices**: the profile picture, the schedule image and those of your playlists, subjects and collections appear on their own on your phone or tablet, and the other way around, in seconds · when cropping an image you can also zoom by pinching on a touch screen.

*1.5.3:* **“Continue as a guest” is back**: you get in instantly, with no account or forms, to try Frame · **link with Google without losing anything**: everything the guest did moves to their account, is added to what it already had without deleting or duplicating, and gets backed up in the cloud.
